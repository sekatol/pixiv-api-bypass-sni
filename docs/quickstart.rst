Quickstart
----------

To start making requests to the Pixiv API, instantiate a client object.

.. code-block:: python

   from pixivapibypasssni import Client

   client = Client()

The client can be authenticated to Pixiv's API in multiple ways. One is by
logging in with a username and password:

.. code-block:: python

   client.login('username', 'password')

And another is with a refresh token.

.. code-block:: python

   client.authenticate('refresh_token')

Once authenticated, a refresh token can be saved for future authorizations.

.. code-block:: python

   refresh_token = client.refresh_token

After authenticating, the client can begin making requests to all of the
Pixiv endpoints. For example, the following code block downloads an
image from Pixiv.

.. code-block:: python

   from pathlib import Path
   from pixivapibypasssni import Size

   illustration = client.fetch_illustration(75523989)
   illustration.download(
       directory=Path.home() / 'my_pixiv_images',
       size=Size.ORIGINAL,
   )

And the next code block downloads all illustrations of an artist.

.. code-block:: python

   from pathlib import Path
   from pixivapibypasssni import Size

   artist_id = 2188232
   directory = Path.home() / 'wlop'

   response = client.fetch_user_illustrations(artist_id)
   while True:
       for illust in response['illustrations']:
           illust.download(directory=directory, size=Size.ORIGINAL)

       if not response['next']:
           break

       response = client.fetch_user_illustrations(
           artist_id,
           offset=response['next'],
       )
